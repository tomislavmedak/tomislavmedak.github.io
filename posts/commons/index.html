.. title: Reconsidering Economics, Struggles and Autonomy in the Digital Commons
.. layout: post
.. date: 2020-08-24 13:25:00 UTC

<p>This text will reflect on some of the issues around digital commons,
primarily free software, from a historical point of view. It will be
looking back at the processes that have shaped the production and access
to digital commons and conceptualizations that were produced in order to
understand their social significance. Concretely, it will focus on four
aspects of the problematic: - economics of digital commons; - continuous
primitive accumulation by means of intellectual property rights; -
possibility of a relative autonomy of cooperative production within the
capitalist mode of production; - possible courses of action for digital
commons activists in the Balkans.</p>
<p>While analyzing the first and the second, it’ll discuss more in
detail issues that relate to free software. However, the debate around
the digital commons – viewed in the context of their emergence over the
last twenty to thirty years with the ascendancy of digital technologies
and the internet – warrants that the concept of digital commons can be
understood very broadly to include a variety of forms of intellectual
production and thus the discussion of free software here touches upon
broader concerns related to digital commons.</p>
<p>As a matter of definition, digital commons are cultural, scientific,
software and educational works that are not restricted in use by
copyright property entitlements – for reasons that they are either not
subject to copyright protection, that the term of protection has
expired, or that their creators have voluntarily made them available
without monetary compensation for sharing and collaborative
peer-production. But given the expansion of copyright and other
intellectual property rights in the same period of thirty years, digital
commons are also in constant danger of future enclosure.</p>
<p>However, as the debate around digital commons revolves around the
antagonisms generated by the application of copyright and intellectual
property rights, it often touches upon three other intensely contested
debates. First, the debate on objects of the material world that through
the development of technologies have become subject to intellectual
property enclosure in the form of patents. Second, the debate around the
monopoly regulation and public access to telecommunication
infrastructures. Third, and probably most frequently, the debate on
illegal access to and sharing of copyrighted works that are often
stigmatized as piracy. Given that the monopoly access to exploitation of
intellectual works, medicines and telecommunication infrastructure
provided by intellectual property rights forms the basis of profits of
the commanding heights of contemporary capitalist enterprise – with
telecommunication, software, media and pharma companies topping the
lists of world’s largest companies – the contestation of these monopoly
entitlements shakes at the strongest pillars of the contemporary
capitalist system and any attempt to think the replacement of
contemporary capitalism has to take them into account. But also given
that the legal practices of commoning and illicit practices of illegal
sharing can have immediate social and developmental equalizing effects,
they provide a recourse within the continuing endurance of real existing
capitalism. This broad problematic thus that has fundamental
implications on both how we envision the anti-capitalist strategy and
everyday autonomy.</p>
<p>But before more is said about the digital commons, three remarks that
shed some light on the discussion of digital commons from the
perspective of technological development and enclosures.</p>
<p>First, and to return the point already made, when debating the
digital comes and their enclosures from a historical point of view, we
cannot leave material resources out of that debate. Simply because the
enclosures in digital commons have over the last two decades gone hand
in hand with the enclosures of some of the essential material resources
for human livelihoods such as healthcare, food production, environmental
engineering, all domains where new enclosures have been made possible by
the advances in digital technologies: e.g. computing technologies used
in genome sequencing or biocomputing. And as the digital technologies
have created conditions for new forms of intellectual production and
generation of material resources, they have also paved the way for their
commodification and increasing levels of control by means of
intellectual property rights. By the late 1990s an offensive was
launched, occasioned by the rise of filesharing networks and the push to
control the copyright in the digital domain, that served as a pretext to
solidify protections over tangible resources such as medicines or crops,
where at that point patents were used to transform e.g. subsistence
agriculture into industrial agriculture producing for global markets or
traditional medicines into pharmaceutical products marketed back to
indigenous communities. These overlapping conflicts over tangible and
intangible resources then prompted allied efforts of free software, open
access in scientific publishing, open education, access2knowledge,
access2medicine and open science proponents to push back that global
offensive.</p>
<p>Secondly, and this gets frequently overlooked by the advocates of the
digital commons such as myself, the rise of digital technologies - while
being emancipatory in many ways - has also implied the technological
advances in productivity that have had a disruptive effect on society
and labour in general. First, through integration, optimization and
standardization of production leading to increased productivity and
competition between capitalist enterprises. Second, through the enabling
effect, they have had on the creation and exponential growth of new
financial instruments and markets. Third, through automation and
substitution of workers by machines. Some of these contradictions
between emancipatory and disruptive features of technologies, and by
implication digital commons, are currently made evident by the debate
around massive open online courses, where open access to education plays
into the hands of administrators in universities in their effort to
deskill and downsize their faculties.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there’s a recent development in the debate about free
software, insofar as computing (software and hardware) is increasingly
transitioning into virtualization and cloud computing, transforming
software from a good into a service, where then technology behind the
service remains completely out of user’s control and access. So, while a
service might be free of charge, actual economic power and control is
concentrated in the infrastructure held closed by the service provider -
e.g. in big data centres and data sets they store - and the ability of
these providers to process the huge amounts of user-generated data and
thus to sell users’ behavior as a commodity to advertisers. (At which
point we might consider turning to Dallas E. Smythe for his analysis of
audience commodity and audience labour.) Thus struggle over data and not
over software is becoming increasingly important in this debate. But let
us now turn to digital commons.</p>
<h1 id="economics-of-digital-commons">Economics of digital commons</h1>
<p>The debate around economic aspects of digital commons, in particular
free software, has been dominated by two very different arguments:</p>
<p>The first has come very early on in the history of free software. It
acknowledged the innovative character of the cooperative form of
production in the free software, attributing it a revolutionary
potential as a post-capitalist form of production. This argument was
first theoretically put forward within the context of the Oekonux
research group in Germany in the late 90s and early 00s (primarily by
Stefan Merten, Stefan Meretz, André Gorz)<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>,
but this view has since persisted particularly in the cultural circles.
In their analysis, they understood free software as providing means of
self-realization for its creators, as being non-commodified and
abundant, and as a ‘seed’-form of a new formation of cooperative
production that would eventually lead into the post-capitalist ‘GNU GPL
society’.</p>
<p>This line of argument was refuted early on by Sabine Nuss and Michael
Heinrich with a talk they delivered within the same context in 2001,
where they have argued that the software is not disruptive to capitalist
valorization, that it can be freely appropriated by the capitalist
enterprise as a free input, that it doesn’t create the means of
subsistence for its creators outside of capitalist mode of production,
and that it can ultimately serve to propel and modernize the capitalist
mode of production.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>But, it is the second argument, which has emerged several years
later, that has dominated the debate since. It has reflected the
shifting terms of the debate that have come with the mainstream adoption
of free software in business, but also with the rise of other
propertyless forms of cooperative production such as Wikipedia or open
access publishing. It was penned in 2002 by Yochai Benkler in his
Coase’s Penguin, or, Linux and The Nature of the Firm.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
There he argues that the free software crystallizes a model of
“commons-based peer production”, a third organizational model of
production alongside the firm and the market. Benkler here draws on
Ronald Coase’s analysis in the Nature of the Firm, where Coase
identifies two fundamental organizational models of economic production
in capitalism - the market and the firm - and explains the economic
rationality for the hierarchical and relatively static organizational
form that makes the firm so prevalent - something that has puzzled the
economists before him. In Coase’s view, the firm emerges for reasons of
lower transaction costs, i.e. costs in finding and contracting skills
and resources necessary in the production of a complex product. Benkler
argues that the commons-based peer production as an emerging, third
organizational model in the production of information exhibits two
salient characteristics: just as the firm it reduces the transaction
costs, just as the market it is non-hierarchical. And at that, it comes
without exclusions of property and separation from the means of
production. Ultimately, in the domains of production where both input
and output are information, where the intangible nature of the product
makes it non-rivalrous and non-excludable, it is superior to both the
firm and the market. “It has particular advantages as an information
process for identifying and allocating human creativity available to
work on information and cultural resources. It depends on very large
aggregations of individuals independently scouring their information
environment in search of opportunities to be creative in small or large
increments.” <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>By operating at the level of institutional microeconomics, Benkler’s
analysis provides probably a better account of the actual economic
organizational potential behind the free software than the utopian
account of Oekonux group. - Although, an analysis today would probably
show that for a while the development model for free software has been a
hybrid of peer producers, firms and freelance skills contracted in the
market, with the growing contributions in code made by the large
enterprises, who use GNU/Linux to power their distributed computing
infrastructures. - But, regardless of that, by formulating the debate
around the ‘political economy’ of digital commons solely in these terms,
ignoring the macroeconomic level and the issues of the capitalist mode
of production, this analysis condemns the understanding of free software
and digital commons to the catechism of neoclassical economics of the
efficient market, transaction costs and price signals. It probably
should come as no surprise that a field studying information should
conflate and reduce the object of its study – information economy – with
a dominant orientation in economic science – information economics. Such
a focus has then lead the arguments that have uncritically espoused
Benkler’s analysis to take for granted the assumptions of information
economics, including its agnosticism towards the limitations to growth
and the availability of resources. This has in turn resulted in a blind
spot where the debate has ignored the issue of the cost of reproduction
of labor that goes into the production of commons.</p>
<p>However, the fact that this theory and its microeconomic approach
have become dominant is not for reasons of its explanatory power. But
rather because it resonates with the efforts by the business-friendly
open source community to make the free software amenable to interests of
profit-making. This ideological shift operated by the open-source
community reflected, however, the actual inability of free software
philosophy to articulate and address the problems of how to sustain the
labour that goes into the cooperative propertyless form of production
that it advocated.</p>
<h1 id="continuous-primitive-accumulation-by-means-of-intellectual-property-rights">Continuous
primitive accumulation by means of intellectual property rights</h1>
<p>While the copyright and patent regulation has started to become
internationally standardized at the end of 19th century, it is only
since the enactment of 1994 Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights
(TRIPS) agreement within the WTO framework that there has been a
coordinated push by a small number of developed nations, who are net
exporters of intellectual property rights, to impose the harmonization
and enforcement of copyright, patents and other intellectual property
rights on other nations. As it was enacted at the height of global AIDS
crisis, the agreement very soon showed its teeth when South Africa
pressed forward and issued a legitimate and legal compulsory license on
AIDS treatment, at that moment when over 10% of its population was
infected, only to be immediately sued by 39 international
pharmaceuticals who were selling AIDS treatment at the hundredfold price
of what the medicine cost South Africa to produce and way above the
price that an overwhelming majority of South African population could
afford. This conflict set off several rounds of international
agreements, the latest being ACTA, where developed and underdeveloped
nations have fought around the terms and the human cost of international
harmonization of intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>These agreements have thrown together under the same regime of
regulation and bargaining very different social goods, ranging from
literature to handbags to medicines to software (it was under the TRIPS
agreement that the computer programs have received the globally
harmonized status and protection under copyright as if they were
“literary works”). Why are they thrown together becomes clear once we
understand that the expansion of intellectual property rights over
medicines, knowledge and culture, and the drive towards international
harmonization of legal regulation and imposition of strict IPRs on less
developed parts of the world are a telltale example of how expanding
circuits of property entitlements, commodification and legal regulation
serve to establish markets first as a mechanism of dispossession and
discipline, and only later as an economic mechanism. This strategy of
prospecting and its disciplining effects become clear when we look at
the example of proprietary software. There the piracy – as one of the
primary targets of global IPR policing – has been tolerated by copyright
holders as a strategy for them to establish de facto monopolies in
operating systems, standards and applications across the globe. At the
same time, stringent regulation has been pushed for, including in those
countries where the weak to the inexistent purchasing power of local
markets does not justify the need for regulation and expansion. This has
helped establish forms of global market concentration that help them
make a killing in profits where and when their products can be
monetized. To anyone coming from the Balkans, this will be a familiar
experience.</p>
<p>These new enclosures, operated from the capitalist centres across the
global space and exploiting the differences in the economic power
between countries and social strata, exhibit a double, complementary
character that Midnight Notes Collective had written about in The New
Enclosures already in 1990.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> The exclusion from the
means of production and the creation of new property relations on the
periphery is always complimentary with the commodification and
marketization targeting the working class in the centre. This double
character can be viewed as a structural feature of global capitalism and
its capacity to defeat class struggles in one location by reconfiguring
its operations across the globe.</p>
<p>As already said in the beginning, and this requires reiterating, in
these parallel circuits of coercive accumulation and commodification in
the domains as various as software production, science publishing,
production of medicines or food, the wholesale character of
international regulation of intellectual property rights meant that the
emerging debate over the protection of copyrightable works in the
digital domain provided a pretext or an occasion to solidify also the
protections over material resources needed for subsistence and the
exclusion of broad parts of the world from the advances in knowledge,
technology, medicine and so on. Because the international IPR treaties
cut deeply into the issues of livelihoods of populations and of
competition between national economies in the global marketplace, most
of whom are in the position of IPR dependency, they have mobilized
primarily popular leftist governments of the global south, but also
scientists, experts and activists working on issues of access to food,
medicine, knowledge and culture to resist these treaties. And this is a
conflict that is still ongoing, as we have seen recently with the
efforts of the most advanced capitalist economies to avoid multilateral
forums such as WTO and WIPO, where their deals have failed to produce
desired outcomes, and impose protections by means of bilateral deals
with which they are - unsuccessfully for now - trying to break the
alliances that have resisted their enforcement efforts so far.</p>
<h1 id="relative-autonomy-of-cooperative-production-within-the-capitalist-world">Relative
autonomy of cooperative production within the capitalist world</h1>
<p>Let me now return to free software with the question of what would be
a relative autonomy of a sphere of cooperative production without
exclusive property operating under the continuous conditions of real
existing capitalism? Or could it be at all?</p>
<p>It obtains more than ever before that the free software is far from
becoming a disruptive force in the development of capitalism and
technology. Both because its model has become seamlessly integrated into
the business models of large capitalist enterprises and because the
development of information technology has made the idea of software as a
packaged and reproduced good protected by copyright less relevant.</p>
<p>Yet still, when considered in the historical context of its
emergence, it can provide us with some understanding of what an attempt
at designing a project of autonomy in the capitalist world might be and
understanding where the free software as a project of creating autonomy
is failing. If we turn to Richard Stallman’s own account of the
emergence of GNU project in the early 1980s – and ignore his political
and ethical justification of software as free speech and duty towards
one’s neighbour – we are met with a story that is precisely an account
of primitive accumulation by separation of workers from their means of
production. In that period the IT companies have started to understand
that the software could be commodified as well and sold as a separate
product from the hardware it was previously shipped with for free. But
in order to achieve that, the code had to be closed off and the software
programmers working collaboratively on the code, most of whom worked at
research labs and academic institutions, excluded from access. By
starting the GNU project and drafting the GNU General Public License, a
legal document that uses the copyright regulation in order to turn it
against its purpose of creating the exclusive property entitlements,
Stallman had designed a process that was aimed at preventing
expropriation and commodification - instead of maximizing the use value,
creating cooperative access to the means of production and allowing
members of the society to have control over the software running many of
the contemporary social processes. Where free software has obviously
failed, it is in the clash with the capacity of market forces to
transform and integrate adverse projects, and more importantly in the
failure to account for the subsistence of programmers developing
software - to advocate free software as a public good and to push for a
broader scope of tangible and intangible to be produced in common.</p>
<p>There are significant limitations to decommodified spheres of
production in a capitalist system. Given the amenability of
commons-based peer production to capitalist valorization process, the
fact that they can easily be integrated as positive externalities,
complements or free inputs into the commodified production process,
their anti-systemic, disruptive and transformative potential remains
limited. However, in a capitalist society, they still achieve a level of
independence from money and effectively constitute an autonomous sphere
of collective production. In order for these forms of cooperative
production to survive, we need to find a way to embed and grow them in a
broader system of cooperative production and as a complement to public
services instead of surrendering them to free-riding markets.</p>
<p>As stated earlier, the commanding heights of contemporary capitalism
hinge on the forms of monopoly created by intellectual property. It is
one of the prime generators of inequality and exclusion that are driving
forward the laws of motion of capitalist expansion and accumulation. The
unhinging of the capitalist system depends on understanding the power
over the economy and democracy exerted by these agents of monopoly
capital. The forceful push towards expansion and implementation of
strict protections by the US and other advanced world economies, where
these agents rank among the largest of companies with inordinate
lobbying and financing power over the regulator and the politics,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> indicates a point where activists in
the dependent countries such as countries of the Balkans, where
populations stand to lose a lot of their access to advanced knowledge
and advanced medicines through the stricter protections, can pressure
their governments to form alliances with other such countries and resist
the harmonization of intellectual property rights and fight for greater
exceptions for their population. For these countries, this is an issue
that links directly to their economic dependence and arrested
development. Furthermore, the activists have to push their governments
to advocate that the intellectual property rights be internationally
broken down and dealt with separately, as cultural works or designer
products involve very different socio-economic aspects than agricultural
products or medicines.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have to develop the broadest most practices of licit and
sometimes illicit commoning that create the autonomy from the monetary
economy, maximize the use value of intellectual goods, overcome the
inequalities of economic barriers and push the contradictions of the
system based on intellectual property rights to their limits. For as
long as the unhinging of capitalism is not complete.</p>

Tomislav Medak is a doctoral student at the Coventry University's [Centre for Postdigital
Cultures](http://www.coventry.ac.uk/research/areas-of-research/postdigital-cultures/). He is also a member of the theory and publishing team of the [Multimedia Institute/MAMA](http://www.mi2.hr/en/) in Zagreb, as well as an amateur librarian for the [Memory of the World/Public library](https://memoryoftheworld.org/) project, an artist in the performing arts collective [BADco.](http://badco.hr/)

With his colleagues at the Multimedia Institute/MAMA, since 2000 he has organised talks, conferences and exhibitions, and edited publications in the fields of political economy, tactical media and the commons. His own research interests are in technology, capitalist development and post-capitalist transition, with a particular focus on environmental crisis, political economy of intellectual property and unevenness of techno-science. At times, he also writes on theatre, dance and politics.

He authored two short books: *The Hard Matter of Abstraction* – *A Guidebook to Domination by Abstraction* (V_____erlag für Handbücher, 2016) and *Shit Tech for A Shitty World* (Aksioma, 2015). He also co-authored several edited volumes: together with Marcell Mars *Public Library* (WHW/Multimedija Institute, 2015) and *Guerrilla Open Access* (Post-office Press, 2018), with Petar Milat *The Idea of Radical Media* (Multimedia Institute/Arkzin, 2014) and with Goran Sergej Pristaš *Time and (In)Completion: Images and Performances of Time in Late Capitalism* (BADco., 2014).

In parallel, he is working as a performer, dramaturge and
director with the Zagreb-based experimental theatre collective BADco. With the collective he has created a number of artworks, including performances *Correcting Rhythm* (2017), *Spores* (2016), *A Pound of Histeria, Acceleration... melodrama* (2014), *The League of Time* (2010) and *1 poor and one 0*. Some of those have toured widely around Europe, while the interactive installation *Responsibility for Things Seen* was presented in 2011 Venice Biennal.

I am an independent researcher with a PhD on technopolitics and planetary environmental crisis from Coventry Unversity's [Centre for Postdigital Cultures](https://www.coventry.ac.uk/research/areas-of-research/postdigital-cultures/). I am a member of the theory and publishing team of [Multimedia Institute/MAMA](https://www.mi2.hr/en/) and a co-instigator of the [Pirate Care](https://pirate.care) project. For twenty years I was a theatre maker with the now dissolved performing arts collective [BADco](http://badco.hr/en/home/). Over the last couple of years, I am politically active as a policy coordinator for the Croatian green-left party [Možemo!](https://mozemo.hr/) What I did and do is mostly defined by these collectives.

My research interests are in technology, capitalist development and post-capitalist transition, with a particular focus on planetary ecological crisis, techno-science and intellectual property. I approach these from Marxian and Degrowth perspectives. Sometimes I also write on theatre, dance, disability and politics. In these pages you will find my writings, information on my artistic work, my biography and my blog. Links in the sidebar will lead you there, but the most relevant and recent is selected below.

If you want to get in touch, my details can be found on the [contact page](/en/contact/).

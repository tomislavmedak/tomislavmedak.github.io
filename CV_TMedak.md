> I am a PhD researcher at the Coventry Unversity's [Centre for Postdigital Cultures](http://www.coventry.ac.uk/research/areas-of-research/postdigital-cultures/). I am also a part of the theory and publishing team of [Multimedia Institute/MAMA](http://www.mi2.hr/en/), an amateur librarian for the [Memory of the World](https://memoryoftheworld.org/) & [Pirate Care](https://pirate.care) initiatives, and a member of the performing arts collective [BADco](http://badco.hr/). What I do is mostly defined by these collective endeavors.

> My research interests are in technology, capitalist development and post-capitalist transition, with a particular focus on planetary ecological crisis, techno-science and intellectual property. I approach these from a Marxian and Degrowth perspective. Sometimes I also present and write on theatre, dance, disability and politics.
